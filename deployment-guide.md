# ðŸš€ Your Deployment Guide

## âœ… Your URLs:
- **Netlify**: `https://game.web-designs.store`
- **Render**: `https://multiplayer-game-52kg.onrender.com`

## ðŸ”§ Netlify Deployment Fix

The error you encountered was due to the build configuration. I've fixed it by:

1. **Updated `netlify.toml`:**
   - Removed the build command since you're using static HTML
   - Set publish directory to `client`

2. **Updated `client/package.json`:**
   - Removed the build script since it's not needed

## ðŸš€ Next Steps:

### 1. Redeploy to Netlify
- Push your changes to GitHub
- Netlify will automatically redeploy
- The error should be resolved

### 2. Configure Render Environment Variables
Go to your Render service dashboard and add:
```
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 3000
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = https://game.web-designs.store
```

### 3. Test the Connection
1. Visit `https://game.web-designs.store`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Check for connection messages
4. Verify no CORS errors

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Netlify site loads without errors
- [ ] Render service is running
- [ ] Browser console shows "Connected to server"
- [ ] No CORS errors in console
- [ ] Login functionality works
- [ ] Game hub interface displays

## ðŸš¨ If Issues Persist:
1. **Check Render logs** for backend errors
2. **Check Netlify logs** for build errors
3. **Verify environment variables** are set in Render
4. **Test locally** first to isolate issues

Your deployment should now work correctly! ðŸŽ®
