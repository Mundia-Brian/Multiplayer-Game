# ðŸ”§ Netlify Deployment Fix

## âœ… Changes Made:

1. **Simplified `netlify.toml`:**
   ```toml
   [build]
     publish = "client"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

2. **Added `client/_redirects`:**
   ```
   /*    /index.html   200
   ```

## ðŸš€ Push These Changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸ§ª What This Fixes:

- **Removes build command** that was causing issues
- **Simplifies configuration** to just publish the client directory
- **Adds proper redirects** for SPA routing
- **Eliminates the 'client/client' error**

## ðŸ“‹ After Pushing:

1. **Netlify will redeploy automatically**
2. **Check deployment logs** for success
3. **Test your site** at `https://game.web-designs.store`

The deployment should now work correctly! ðŸŽ®
